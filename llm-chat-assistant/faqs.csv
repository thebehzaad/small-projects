What are the different types of car insurance?,"Budget Direct offers three types of car insurance cover: Comprehensive Car Insurance covers loss or damage to your car due to an accident (regardless of who’s at fault), severe weather, fire, vandalism, and theft; and your liability for accidental damage your car causes to other people’s property (e.g. their car and home). Third Party Property Only Car Insurance covers your liability for accidental damage your car causes to other people’s property (e.g. their car and home). It does not cover damage to your car (unless it’s damaged in a no-fault accident with an uninsured driver, in which case your car has limited cover). Third Party Property, Fire and Theft Car Insurance provides the same protection as Third Party Property Only, plus cover for loss or damage to your car if it’s stolen or catches fire. The type of cover you have is shown on your car insurance certificate and in your online account .

Which insurance covers loss or damage to my car?,"Our comprehensive car insurance policy covers loss or damage to your car due to an accident (regardless of who’s at fault), severe weather, fire, vandalism, and theft."
Which insurance covers damage to someone else's car?,Our comprehensive and third party property policies all cover your liability for accidental damage your car causes to other people’s property (e.g. their car and home).
Is comprehensive car insurance mandatory?,"No – there is only one type of car insurance in Australian that is mandatory, namely compulsory third party (CTP) insurance. All the other types of car insurance are voluntary, including comprehensive cover. Though comprehensive car insurance is technically voluntary, if you finance or lease a car, the lender or lessor will likely require to you take out comprehensive cover."
I already have CTP; do I need Comprehensive Insurance?,"Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance covers any personal injury your car causes. However, this doesn’t cover any damage to your car (or other cars or property) that your car might cause. To make sure you’re covered against damage to property (both your own and others’), having Comprehensive Insurance offers this cover. There are also plenty of added benefits to having Comprehensive Car Insurance, such as: Full coverage for damage caused by an uninsured driver Towing Hire car following either theft or a no fault accident New car replacement (if your car is under 2 years old and has driven less than 40,000km) Damage or theft of personal effects in your car. If you’re not sure which level of insurance is best for your car, check out our simple Car Insurance Comparison Guide . Also, make sure you read the Product Disclosure Statement for all the terms, conditions and benefits of Comprehensive, Third Party Property Only and Third Party Property, Fire, and Theft Car Insurance."
Which car insurance provides the most protection?,"Of Budget Direct’s three types of motor-vehicle cover, our comprehensive car insurance , as its name suggests, provides the most protection. It covers not only your liability for the damage your car causes to other people’s property , including their vehicles, but also damage to your car ."
Is it worth having fully comprehensive insurance on an old car?,"Your decision on whether to comprehensively insure your old car will generally depend on: its market value; and your ability to cover the financial loss on your own if your car was, say, written off in an accident. If your car has a low market value (e.g. $2,500), you may decide third party car insurance is all you need. In other words, you may decide it’s not worth paying more for comprehensive car insurance as, over time, it could outweigh the cost of replacing your cheap car. It’s up to you to do the maths: Figure out whether the lower protection and cheaper premium are a reasonable trade-off in your circumstances."
"What would be the point in having third party property insurance, which does not cover damage to my car due to collision?","If your car has a low market value, you may decide that third party property cover is adequate. In other words, you may decide it’s not worth paying a higher premium for comprehensive car insurance as, over time, it could outweigh the cost of replacing your car if it was damaged in an accident. Also, although third party property insurance does not cover damage to your car, it does cover your liability for damage your car causes to other people’s property, saving you having to pay their potentially expensive repair bills. Note that Budget Direct third party property insurance does provide limited cover – up to $5,000 (including recovery, towing and storage costs) – for damage caused to your car by an uninsured driver."
"Would Third Party Property, Fire and Theft Insurance cover attempted theft-related damage to my car or personal items stolen from my car?",No – that level of protection is provided by comprehensive car insurance .
What does ‘liability’ mean when it comes to car insurance?,"Your ‘liability’ is essentially your responsibility for any damage your car might cause to another person’s vehicle, property, or any other damage you would be legally liable for."
What car insurance do I need for business use or work?,"Budget Direct insures cars used for business or work, excluding those used for: carrying passengers for payment, including taxis and/or ridesharing (e.g. Uber, Didi) carrying or delivering other people’s goods for payment, whether as a contractor or otherwise (e.g. parcel or food delivery) driving tuition for payment unpaid driving tuition of a person who is: excluded on the insurance certificate by name or age; or a household member that is not listed on the insurance certificate hiring the car to other people. If your business use is not excluded, you can choose one of three types of car insurance . When getting a quote and buying cover, you must select either ‘Private and Occasional Business Use’ or ‘Private and Business Use’ as the permitted use. In addition, you must give us the details of all the drivers who will use the car for business purposes. (If you use your car only to commute to and from your regular place of work, you will need to select ‘Private and Commuting Use’.)"
What car insurance do I need if I’m leasing the car?,"If you’ve decided to lease a car instead of buy one, the lessor may be able to arrange your insurance for you or you can choose your own provider. Either way, the lessor will likely require you to take out comprehensive car insurance on the leased car. It’s important to note that the market value of new cars depreciates quickly in the first few years. Consequently, if your leased car is stolen or written off in an accident, the amount an insurance company pays you may be less than the amount you still owe the lessor. For this reason, you may wish to buy additional ‘gap insurance’ through the lessor, which is designed to cover the shortfall. (This is assuming the lessor has not already included the cost of this cover in your lease payments.) If you choose Budget Direct Comprehensive Car Insurance , you’ll have to let us know who the lessor is. Does my cover include a new-car replacement?"

However, if it’s your car you’ll be driving, and you’ll be driving it more often than anyone else, you can get a quote for your own insurance policy online ."
"When taking out car insurance, what do I need to tell you?","When you get a quote for car insurance, we’ll ask you a series of questions about you (and any other drivers) and your car. For example, we’ll ask you how the car will be used, where it will be parked at night, and about the insured drivers’ driving and claims history. Your answers will help us assess the risk of insuring you and your car and, in turn, calculate your premium. It’s therefore important you answer the questions truthfully and completely."
Why do you want to know about my car insurance claims history?,"When you get a quote for Budget Direct car insurance, we’ll ask you about your claims history – specifically any claims you’ve made over the past five years. This helps us to accurately assess the risk of insuring you and your car and calculate the cost – your premium. It’s therefore critical this information is complete and correct. If it’s not — if you under-report your previous claims — we can reduce the amount we pay you if you make a claim; or deny the claim."
How can I find out about my car insurance claims history?,"When you get a quote for Budget Direct car insurance, we’ll ask you about your claims history over the past five years. Not everyone can remember how many claims they’ve made in that time and/or the relevant details. If you’re unsure, contact your previous insurer/s to request a report on the claims you’ve made with them over the past five years."
How are car insurance premiums calculated?,"There are lots of factors that can influence the cost of car insurance — your premium — including: your policy, including the level of cover and excess amount the drivers, especially their ages and claims history the car, including its value and performance where you live how you use the car. For more details, read our article about the cost of insurance ."
How much can I insure my car for?,"With Budget Direct, you can insure your car for its market value or, in some cases, for an agreed value. Market value is the value of the car at the time of the loss or damage, taking into account factors such as the make, model, age, kilometres travelled and overall condition. We may use local market prices, recognised industry publications or other sources to determine the market value. To get an idea of what your car may be worth, search for it in the Red Book or on car sales websites. Please note that the prices provided by these sites are only meant to be a guide. Your car's market value will be determined by us at the time of the loss or damage. Agreed value is the amount we agree to insure your car for. We may offer you an agreed value, provided: your car is less than 10 years old; and your car has not been converted to LPG; and the car has no pre-existing damage; and the agreed value is within an acceptable range of the market value. The value for which your car is covered is shown on your insurance certificate and in your online account ."
Which drivers must be listed on my car insurance policy?,"With Budget Direct, you must list any household members (including learner, provisional and occasional drivers) who may drive the car. Unlisted household members won’t be covered. Any non-household members who are not excluded drivers (e.g. due to age restrictions) are automatically covered. If you list them on your policy, you’ll avoid having to pay the unlisted driver excess ( other excesses may apply )."
My child just received their probationary licence; do I need to list them as a nominated driver?,"In any circumstances, it’s smarter to list them as a nominated driver on your policy. If your child lives with you, they must be listed as a nominated driver to be covered under your insurance. If they don’t live with you, their age may exclude them from coverage, depending on your policy. Either way, these situations can be avoided by listing your child on your insurance."
Can my insured car be kept at a different address to the one on my policy?,"Car insurance premiums are partly based on the postcode in which your car is normally kept overnight; and whether it’s kept in a garage, carport or on the street. By normally , we mean most of the time. For the majority of people, the location they normally park their car overnight is the same place they reside. However, your Budget Direct-insured car is still covered if you keep it somewhere else overnight (e.g. if you’re staying with family and friends across town or interstate). Just as long as you keep your car elsewhere less than you keep it in the postcode stated in your insurance policy. Budget Direct car insurance is conditional on the policyholder and/or regular driver living at the same address the car is usually kept. If you need to change the postcode where your car is mostly kept, you can edit your policy via your online account ."
Can I transfer my no-claim bonus or driver rating from my current car insurer to Budget Direct?,"Yes – as long as you send us proof of your current no-claim bonus (or no-claim discount, as we call it) or driver rating. This proof – which you must send us within 14 days of the start of your Budget Direct policy – can be in the form of a renewal offer or letter from your current insurer. First, please check to see if you have received an email or SMS from Budget Direct with a secure link that will allow you to upload your NCD proof - don’t forget to check your junk or spam folder. If you haven’t received either an email or SMS, then please send any renewal offer or letter – with the subject line ‘NCD [ policy number ]’ – to: Email: csd@autogeneral.com.au Fax:      07 3377 8855 Post:    Auto and General Services PO Box 342 Toowong QLD 4066 We’ll factor in the rating when we calculate your premium. Important: We plan to stop using NCD in the future. This means that your NCD is not guaranteed to apply to future policy renewals."
What is 'Gold Comprehensive Car Insurance'?,Budget Direct Gold Comprehensive Car Insurance is the highest level of protection we offer for your car. The Gold Car Insurance policy can be bought online for a discount. Find out more about Gold Comprehensive Car Insurance
How do I buy a 'low kilometres' policy?,"If you drive 10,000km or less per year, you can take out a Gold Low Kilometres Comprehensive policy, which attracts a lower premium."
Can car insurance be in joint names?,"Yes — a Budget Direct car insurance policy can be held by two or more people in joint names. Each person is authorised to act on behalf of all policyholders. You may elect to appoint someone, such as a family member, to represent you as an authorised person with the same authority as a policyholder. We will treat a statement, act, omission, claim, or request by any policyholder or authorised person as having been made by all policyholders or authorised people. This includes requesting to change the policy, cancel the policy or make a claim under the policy. The person who drives the car the most must be listed as the regular driver; it is their no claim discount or driver rating that is used to help calculate the premium. In addition, all household members (i.e. people who live together) who drive the car must be listed on the policy, otherwise they will not be covered. Anyone can pay for the policy, regardless of whether they’re one of the joint policyholders and/or listed drivers."
Can I have two car insurance policies?,"Yes — with Budget Direct you can take out two or more separate car insurance policies (one per car) in your name. On each policy you must be listed as one of the drivers; whoever drives the car the most must be listed as the regular driver. We do not offer multi-vehicle car insurance policies , whereby multiple vehicles — typically owned by people residing at the same address — are bundled into one policy. If you’re thinking of taking out two policies for one car, think again. Not only will you be paying two premiums, if you make an at-fault claim you’ll have to pay both policies’ excesses; and the combined insurance payout will not exceed your loss."
Can I get car insurance for multiple cars?,"Some insurers offer multi-vehicle car insurance, whereby two or more vehicles are insured under the same policy and payments are combined into one bill. These multi-car insurance policies are mainly designed to reduce paperwork; they may also earn you a discount on your premiums. Even though they’re insured under one policy, each car is treated separately, based on its make and model, who drives it, where it’s kept overnight, the level of cover, etc. Budget Direct does not offer multi-vehicle car insurance, however if you buy cover from us online we’ll discount your first year’s premium by 15%. And you can keep track of your insurance easily by linking all your car and other policies in your online account ."
Will you insure a car that’s got pre-existing damage?,"When you get a quote to buy Budget Direct car insurance, we’ll ask you whether your car has any existing hail and/or accident damage. If it does, our decision whether to cover your car will depend on how much damage it has. If we agree to cover your car, we’ll ask you to upload photos of it via our Online Car Inspection website, or have the car checked at a nearby inspection station."
When does my car insurance take effect?,"Your Budget Direct car insurance will take effect the day you buy the policy – unless you’ve chosen a later date for your cover to begin, in which case it will take effect on that date."
Will I need a car insurance cover note or letter?,"Budget Direct doesn’t issue cover notes, which are temporary documents issued by some insurers to cover policyholders until they receive their formal insurance documents. Instead, when you buy a policy from us, we’ll give you a policy number – confirmation your car is covered."
What if I'm selling or trading in a car and buying another one?,"If you’re trading in your car, you’re responsible for it until the purchaser/dealer takes possession of your car. You can then insure your new car by changing the car details on your existing Budget Direct policy, either by calling us on 1300 306 560 or logging into your online account and editing your policy. If you replace your Budget-Direct-insured car with a similar one, we’ll automatically provide the same level of cover for your replacement car for 14 days from the purchase date – even if you don’t contact us. (Cover for your previous car ends at the same time.) Your replacement car will be temporarily insured for its market value or purchase price, whichever is lower. You’ll just need to make sure you update your existing policy before the temporary cover expires."
I'm insuring a car bought on finance – do I need to do anything in particular?,"If you’re buying your car on finance, ask the finance company whether they have any special insurance requirements. They usually require the car to be comprehensively insured and for you to provide proof of insurance – a certificate of currency, for example, which we can give you."
The car finance company has asked me for a certificate of currency – what’s that?,"A certificate of currency is a document that proves your car is insured. Among other things, the certificate shows the period of insurance, the sum insured, and the interested party, namely the finance company. It assures the finance company that, if your car was written off in an accident, the company would be the first to be paid out."
How can I get my certificate of currency?,You can download your certificate of currency from your online account immediately after purchasing your Budget Direct car insurance; or you can call us on 1300 306 560 to request the certificate.
What car insurance policy documents can I expect to receive?,"Your Budget Direct car insurance policy documents comprise: Certificate of insurance – your proof of insurance, including your sum insured, excesses and add-on benefits. Policy schedule – contains a summary of what you have disclosed to us in regard to the insured car and drivers. Product disclosure statement – tells you everything you need to know about the product, including the terms, conditions, limits and exclusions that apply; and how to make a claim."
Is it the car that's insured or the driver?,"It’s the car that’s insured, however it’s extremely important to consider who will be driving it. If you’ve chosen to restrict your Budget Direct policy to drivers above a certain age (21+, 25+, 30+, 40+ or 50+), your car will be covered only while being driven by someone over that age. Moreover, household members who drive your car will be covered only if they are listed on your policy. Non-household members who are not excluded drivers (e.g. due to age restrictions) are automatically covered to drive your car. By listing them, you’ll avoid having to pay the unlisted driver excess in the event of a claim."
"Can I get short-term car insurance – for example, for a day, a week, a month?","No – Budget Direct car insurance policies are effective for one year (although you can choose to pay your premium fortnightly, monthly or annually)."
At what age does the cost of car insurance go down?,"Generally, the younger you are, the more you’ll pay for car insurance That’s because young drivers are statistically more likely to have an accident. As they age (and gain driving experience) and all other things being equal, their premium will generally come down. This happens gradually — there is no particular age at which the cost of car insurance suddenly drops. However, age is just one of numerous factors taken into consideration when calculating a person’s premium. Claims history is also critical. It can mean a 40-year-old driver with two at-fault claims in the past two years, say, pays more for their cover than a 25-year-old with a driver rating of 1 who has had no claims. To find out more about how car insurance premiums are calculated and how you can save on yours, read our ‘How much does car insurance cost?’ article ."
Can a person be denied car insurance?,"Yes – insurers are not legally required to provide car insurance to anyone who requests it, though it’s rare for someone to be denied cover. Among the reasons an insurer might deny someone cover are licence cancellations/disqualifications, drink and/or drug driving offences, criminal convictions (e.g. for insurance fraud) or an adverse claims history."
What car insurance can I get with a suspended drivers license?,"If your drivers licence is suspended — due to unpaid fines, an accumulation of demerit points, or a high-speed offence, for example — it’s illegal for you to drive. Consequently, insurers may not cover any car you propose to drive. Once your licence is reinstated, you may be able to get cover, though your premium may be higher due to your driving record. As long as you hold a valid Australian drivers licence or permit, you can apply for Budget Direct car insurance. If we ask you questions, it’s important to tell us anything relevant to our decision to ensure you and under what terms; we’ll then consider your application. If we don’t offer you cover, you may be able to find an insurer who will on the Find an Insurer website ."
Does Budget Direct insure driverless cars?,"Currently, there are no fully driverless cars for sale in Australia.

You can also push back your payment date by up to 14 days, for example if you get a new job and your pay cycle changes; or if you’re temporarily short of funds."
How do I change my payment details?,To change your Budget Direct car insurance payment details: Log into your online account View your car policy. Click or tap the ‘View/Change Payment Details’ or ‘Payment Details’ button. Follow the prompts.
Is it cheaper to pay my car insurance premium annually?,"Yes - By paying annually instead of in instalments (i.e. fortnightly or monthly), you’ll pay a lower premium and avoid instalment processing fees."
When is my next premium payment due?,To find out when your next fortnightly or monthly instalment is due: Log into your online account View your car policy. Click or tap on the ‘View/Change Payment Details’ or ‘Payment Details’ button.
Can I delay a car insurance payment?,"Yes – you can delay a fortnightly or monthly instalment by up to 14 days, for example if you get a new job and your pay cycle changes; of if you’re temporarily short of funds."
What if I miss a payment?,"If you miss a premium payment, we’ll send you a friendly reminder via SMS. To pay your overdue premium, you can either: click on the link in the SMS and follow the instructions; or log into your online account and follow the prompts."
What happens if I stop paying my car insurance premiums?,"If you stop paying your premiums, we’ll send you friendly reminders. If your premium payment is overdue by 14 days or more, any claim you make can be refused. If your payment is overdue by a month or more, your policy will be cancelled. Experiencing financial difficulty? Please contact us to discuss your options."
Are car insurance premiums tax deductible?,"If you use your own car for business or work, you may be able to claim your car insurance premiums as a tax deduction. For example, if you use your car to earn an income (e.g. operating a ride-hailing service) or as an employee in the course of your work (e.g. travelling between work sites). Generally, you can't claim the cost of commuting to and from home and work as this travel is considered to be private. Assuming your car is used for business and personal reasons, you’ll need to separate the expenses as only business use can be claimed as a deduction. This information was correct as of 1 November 2019. For more, visit the Australian Taxation Office’s ‘Car expenses’ web page ."
I’ve had a car accident – what should I do?,"If you’ve had an accident, and assuming you’re physically able to, you should: Make sure you and anyone else involved is safely off the road. Call 000 if there are injuries or hazards. Get the details of the other drivers — name, address, contact number, vehicle owner (if they don’t own it) and registration number — and give them yours (it’s a legal requirement; if anyone refuses, call the police). Try to get the names, addresses, and contact numbers of any witnesses. If it’s safe to do so, take photographs at the accident scene. If your vehicle is undriveable, call us on 1300 885 996 to organise a tow or, if you prefer, book your own. Make a claim Download our car accident guide"
My car’s been stolen — what should I do?,"Report it to the police; they’ll give you a reference number, which you’ll need to pass on to us. Make a claim"
What if someone blames me for causing an accident that was their fault?,"If another driver accuses you of causing an accident you believe was their fault, tell them you’re going to leave it to the insurance companies to sort out. When you lodge your claim with Budget Direct, we’ll contact the other driver’s insurer. Between us, we’ll determine who was at fault, based on the evidence. This can include photos, dashcam footage, independent eyewitness accounts, physical proof, the Australian Road Rules, police reports, etc. Read more about claims for car accidents that were not your fault"
"If the car accident was my fault, should I admit it to the other driver?","No — even though you think the accident was completely your fault, that may not necessarily be the case. Perhaps the other driver, unbeknownst to you, broke a road rule and that breach contributed to the accident? So, it’s best not to admit liability and to let us work with the other driver’s insurer to determine which driver was at fault. (Sometimes two or more drivers can share responsibility for a car accident.)"
What should I do if the other driver refuses to give me their details at the accident scene?,"By law, drivers involved in car accidents must exchange their details (i.e. name, address, contact number, vehicle owner — if they don’t own it — and registration number). If you’re in an accident — even a minor one — and the other driver refuses or fails to provide their details, call the police. They’ll follow it up."
Do I have to call the police to report a minor accident?,"Police forces around Australia typically do not require you to report minor accidents to them. Minor accidents are generally those in which: no one is injured the vehicles are still driveable (i.e. they do not need to be towed) no other motorists are endangered (e.g. by spilt fuel or fallen power lines). For more information, contact your state or territory police force."
Can you arrange for my vehicle to be towed?,"Yes — if your comprehensively insured car is undriveable, we can arrange for it to be towed from the accident scene to the tow company’s yard and, in turn, to our motor-vehicle assessors and repairers. If you have Third Party Property, Fire and Theft cover , we can arrange a tow if your vehicle is burnt or found after being stolen. Note that residents of Melbourne, Mornington Peninsula, Geelong and Adelaide are required by law to call an ‘allocation centre’ or ‘centralised operator’, who will arrange the tow on their behalf."
My car’s been damaged in an accident caused by a Budget Direct customer — what happens now?,"When you report the incident to us, we’ll arrange for your car’s damage to be assessed. On acceptance of your claim, we’ll authorise the repairs or pay you a cash settlement. Throughout the claims process, you can expect to receive the same level of service we give our own customers."

What is an at fault car insurance claim?,"Budget Direct defines an ‘at fault claim’ as any claim that cannot be recovered from another party, either in part or in full, such as: an accident where, given all available evidence, it is reasonable for us to decide the driver of the Budget Direct-insured car is partially or entirely at fault an accident where, given all available evidence, it is reasonable for us to decide the driver of the other vehicle or another person is entirely at fault but you cannot tell us, or we cannot obtain, their full name, residential address and vehicle registration number theft, attempted, theft or a malicious act storm, wind or hail fire an accident involving an animal. If you make an at fault claim, you’ll need to pay the applicable excess/es; and, subject to No Claim Discount (NCD) being a factor considered when determining the premium you pay, your NCD will be reduced by two levels (unless you have NCD Protection ). Note that your discount is not affected by claims arising from storm, wind or hail damage (even if you don’t have NCD Protection)."
Is there a time limit for making a car insurance claim?,"You must notify us immediately of any incident involving your car that may lead to a claim. It’s also advisable to formally lodge your claim as soon as possible, to avoid any complications a delay might cause. Any theft or malicious damage to your car must be reported to the police as soon as possible. They’ll give you a reference number, which you’ll need to give us when you claim."
Can I make an insurance claim if the accident was my fault?,"Yes — accidents happen. Simply lodge your claim. Once your claim has been accepted, pay the applicable excess/es. We’ll then settle the claim with the other driver’s insurer (or, if they’re uninsured, the other driver). Unless you have NCD Protection , your no-claim discount will be reduced by two levels on renewal of your policy. This is subject to NCD being a factor considered when determining the premium you pay."
Should I contact my insurance company if I’m in an accident that was not my fault?,"Yes — Budget Direct requires its customers to notify it immediately of any incident involving their car that may lead to a claim, including accidents they did not cause. (This requirement applies even if they do not end up making a claim.)"
What happens if I make a car insurance claim for an accident that was not my fault?,"If we decide the accident was not your fault, we’ll arrange for your car’s damage to be assessed and repaired. If you tell us, or we obtain, the full name, residential address and vehicle registration number of the at fault driver or person, you won’t have to pay an excess. We’ll provide you with a complimentary hire car to drive while yours is being repaired. We’ll then recover the repair costs from the other driver’s insurer."
Can I make an insurance claim for car dents?,"Car insurance is designed to cover the cost of repairing damage to your car, including dents. The main thing to consider is whether an excess is payable on a claim; and, if so, how your excess compares to the repair quote. If someone rams a shopping trolley into your car and the cost of repairing the dent is lower than your excess, it would not make sense to claim. However, if your car’s panels are dimpled by hail, it’s likely the cost of repairing the dents will be higher than your excess. In this instance, it would make sense to claim. Note that if you make a claim for dents your car has accumulated over time, an excess will be payable for each incident that dented your car."
What documents do I need to provide when making a car insurance claim?,"When you make a claim on your Budget Direct car insurance, you won’t have to fill in any physical forms (it’s all done online or over the phone). On rare occasions, we may ask you to provide us with certain documents (e.g. your driving history). If we do, you can send these documents to us via your online account or by emailing them to motorclaims@autogeneral.com.au"
How do I send you the documents supporting my claim?,Please email the documents supporting your car insurance claim to motorclaims@autogeneral.com.au
Can I make a car insurance claim without a police report?,"You must give Budget Direct a copy of a police report (or report reference number) when you make a car insurance claim for: theft malicious damage an accident in which another driver failed to exchange details For all other claims, a police report is not required."
"Can I lodge a claim with the other, at fault driver’s insurance company?","Yes, however, if you’re a Budget Direct customer and someone else causes damage to your car, there’s no need for you to lodge a claim with their insurer. Just contact us and we’ll take care of everything for you, saving you time and hassle. We’ll arrange for your car’s damage to be assessed and repaired.

We’ll provide you with a complimentary hire car."
Will I ever need to communicate with the other driver’s insurer?,"When claiming on your Budget Direct car insurance, you’ll seldom, if ever, be required to communicate with the other driver’s insurer. We can deal with the other driver’s insurer on your behalf, saving you time and hassle. If you receive correspondence (e.g. a letter of demand) from the other driver or their insurer, do not reply. Contact us and we’ll handle the matter for you."
"If I make a claim, will I lose my no-claim bonus?","If you make a claim, it’s effect on your no-discount discount (NCD) will depend on whether it’s an at-fault claim or a no-fault one. If it’s an at-fault claim , your discount will be reduced by two levels on renewal of your policy (unless you have NCD Protection ). For example, if you had a Rating 1 (maximum no-claim discount) and you made one at-fault claim in a given year, your rating would drop to 3. This means the current discount on your Budget Direct Comprehensive Car Insurance premium would fall from 15% (Rating 1) to 9% (Rating 3). If it’s a no-fault claim , your discount will not be affected. This is subject to NCD being a factor considered when determining the premium you pay. Important: We plan to stop using NCD in the future. This means that your NCD is not guaranteed to apply to future policy renewals. See all no-claim discount FAQs"
Which driver is at fault in a rear-end car accident?,"Typically, the driver who rear ends the car in front is presumed to be at fault. That’s because the tailing driver is expected to leave enough distance between them and the car in front to avoid a collision if it suddenly and unexpectedly slows down or stops. The drivers’ insurers will consider all the evidence — including any dash cam footage — before determining liability."
Which driver is at fault if a car side-swipes another?,Side-swipe accidents typically involve two cars hitting each other while travelling in the same direction on a multi-lane highway or motorway. They’re often the result of drivers failing to check their blind spots before changing lanes; or becoming distracted and drifting into another lane. The drivers’ insurers will consider all the evidence — including any dash cam footage —before determining liability. They may decide one of the drivers is liable or that both drivers contributed to the accident.
What if someone hits my parked car and takes off without leaving a note?,"First the good news: If you have comprehensive insurance your car is covered for the cost of repairing damage caused by a hit-and-run driver. Now for the bad news: Unfortunately, unless you can give us, or we can obtain, the full name, residential address and vehicle registration number of the other driver, it will be treated as an at fault accident. This means you’ll be required to pay the applicable excesses; and, subject to No Claim Discount (NCD) being a factor considered when determining the premium you pay, your NCD will be reduced by two levels (unless you have NCD Protection ). (It will be recorded as a no fault claim in your claims history.)"

What if my stolen car is found but is damaged?,"If your stolen vehicle is found and the damage bill is greater than your excess, we’ll either pay for it to be repaired, or write it off and pay you the amount for which your car is covered."

Do no-fault accident claims go on your car insurance record?,"Yes — all car insurance claims, including no-fault ones — are recorded in your claims history."
What is a car insurance excess?,"A car insurance excess is the fixed amount you pay towards a claim. Depending on the circumstances of the incident that led to your claim, you may have to pay more than one excess: your Basic Excess plus any additional excesses that apply. For example, if someone under the age of 21 causes an accident while driving your car, you’ll have to pay your Basic Excess (let’s assume it’s $600) plus an additional excess of $600 due to the driver’s age. It means that, if the damage bill was $5,000, say, you would pay $1,200 and we would pay $3,800. Your Basic Excess and the additional excesses are shown on your Insurance Certificate. If you make a claim, we’ll tell you which excesses apply and when and how to pay them. You won’t have to pay an excess if the accident is deemed a no-fault accident ."
What is the purpose of a car insurance excess?,A car insurance excess is designed mainly to eliminate small claims that have a high administrative cost relative to the value of the claim – which in turn helps keep your premiums down.
Does the excess apply to each accident or incident?,Yes – the excess applies to each separate accident or incident that results in a claim.
What is a basic excess in car insurance?,"Budget Direct’s Basic Excess is effectively the minimum excess you’re required to pay for an at-fault car insurance claim . The amount of your Basic Excess depends on the state or territory in which your car is kept; by increasing your premium, you may be able to lower your Basic Excess (and vice-versa). Depending on the circumstances of the accident that led to your claim, you may have to pay more than one excess: your Basic Excess plus any additional excesses that apply. We’ll tell you when and how to pay us the excesses."
"If I make a car insurance claim, what will the excess be?","Unless you or another driver of your car have a no-fault accident , you’ll be required to pay: your Basic Excess : the amount depends on the state/territory in which your car is kept; you may be able to increase it to lower your comprehensive insurance premium (and vice-versa). ….as well as any additional excesses that apply, namely: driver is under 21 years of age driver is 21 to 24 years of age inclusive driver has not held a full Australian or open licence for 2 or more years driver is not listed on your Insurance Certificate car has exceeded the kilometres per year selected, no odometer reading was provided or an invalid odometer reading was provided (applies only to Gold Low Kilometres Comprehensive policies). The dollar amounts of your Basic Excess and the additional excesses are shown on your Insurance Certificate and can also be viewed in your online account ."
Can I change my car insurance excess?,"If you’re a comprehensive policyholder, you may, for a higher premium, be able to reduce your Basic Excess or, for a lower premium, increase it. You can change your Basic Excess at any time by calling us on 1300 306 560 or logging into your online account and editing your policy. (The additional excesses cannot be changed.)"
Is there a driver-age excess?,"Yes – Budget Direct car insurance policies require you to pay a driver-age excess if the driver of your car causes an accident and is aged under 25. This driver-age excess is an extra amount you pay in addition to your Basic Excess. This additional excess applies regardless of whether the driver is listed on your policy. (Note that, to be covered, all household members must be listed.) The dollar amounts of all additional excesses are shown on your Insurance Certificate and can also be viewed in your online account . See all car insurance excesses"
Is there an unlisted-driver excess?,"Yes – if an unlisted driver of your car causes an accident, you’ll have to pay an additional, unlisted driver excess (over and above your Basic Excess). You can avoid this additional excess by listing all drivers on your policy. Note that, to be covered, household members must be listed on your policy. The dollar amounts of all additional excesses are shown on your Insurance Certificate and can also be viewed in your online account . See all car insurance excesses"
Who pays the excess on a car insurance claim?,"Budget Direct car insurance policyholders are required to pay an excess if they make an at fault claim . This includes drivers who are wholly or partly to blame for an accident. You won’t have to pay an excess if we decide another driver (or person) was entirely at fault and you can tell us, or we can obtain, their full name, residential address and vehicle registration number."
Do I have to pay an excess if the accident was not my fault?,"You do not have to pay an excess if you have a no fault accident. A no fault accident is one that meets the following criteria: we decide the driver of another vehicle (or another person) was entirely at fault, and you tell us, or we obtain, the at fault driver's full name, address, and vehicle registration number."
Do I have to pay an excess if my car's been stolen?,"Yes – if your car’s been stolen you have to pay an excess, but only your Basic Excess."
Do I have to pay an excess if my car's been damaged by hail?,"Yes – if your car’s been damaged by severe weather, including hail or floodwater, you have to pay an excess, but only your Basic Excess."
Do I have to pay an excess if my car's windscreen has been cracked or smashed?,"Yes — your window-glass (including windscreen) excess is the same as your Basic Excess, however you have the option of reducing your window-glass excess to just $40. You can do this when you buy a policy or — if you’ve already bought one — by calling us on 1300 306 560 or logging into your online account and editing your policy. Note that you can reduce your window-glass excess only within 21 days of buying your policy, renewing it, or transferring it to a replacement vehicle. Read more about windscreen and window-glass insurance"
Do I have to pay an excess if my car's been vandalised?,"Yes – if your car’s been vandalised, or maliciously damaged, you have to pay an excess, but only your Basic Excess."
Do I have to pay an excess if my car's a write-off?,"Yes – unless you or another driver of your car have a no-fault accident , you have to pay the Basic Excess and any additional excesses that apply."
When is a car insurance excess paid?,"If your car is repairable, we’ll ask you to pay your car insurance excess before the repairs start. If your car is written off and we are paying you a total loss settlement, we’ll deduct the excess from the final settlement amount we pay you. If we settle your claim under the New Car Replacement benefit, we’ll ask you to pay your excess before we replace your car."
Can I pay my car insurance excess in instalments?,"Normally, a car insurance excess is paid as a lump sum, not in instalments. If you can’t pay it as a lump sum due to financial hardship , you can ask us whether you might be entitled to assistance. If you are, we may give you longer to pay the excess or allow you to pay it in instalments, for example."
How do I get my car's damage assessed and repaired?,Budget Direct has a national network of around 180 repairers who can assess your car's damage and/or repair it. We also have seven dedicated assessment centres. When you lodge your claim via your online account or over the phone (1300 139 591) you will be able to secure your booking.
Where must I take my car for its damage assessment?,"If your damaged car is driveable, we’ll ask you to take it to one of the following, depending on your location: one of our network repairers, who will also be able to fix your car; or one of our vehicle assessment centres – in Sydney, Melbourne, or Brisbane; or a local repairer (if there isn’t a network repairer or assessment centre near you). If your car is assessed by a local repairer, we’ll ask them to send us a repair-cost estimate and images of your car’s damage. We’ll then decide whether to assess your car remotely or to send one of our own assessors to inspect your car’s damage."
My car has hail damage – what happens next?,"If your car is damaged by hail, we’ll arrange an assessment with our specialised hail repairer. They’ll assess your car and advise on the best repair approach. Depending on the amount of damage to your car, we may be able to use a paintless dent repair technique that removes dents and dimples without the need for traditional bodywork and repainting. This technique involves gently pushing or massaging the dented metal back into shape. It’s usually faster than traditional repairs and preserves your car’s original factory finish because there’s no need for repainting."
What if my car’s not driveable?,"If your damaged car is not driveable, call us on 1300 139 591 and we’ll arrange for it to be towed to a safe location for an assessment. Note that residents of Melbourne, Mornington Peninsula, Geelong and Adelaide are required by law to call an ‘allocation centre’ or ‘centralised operator’, who will arrange the tow on their behalf."
What exactly does a motor-vehicle assessor do?,"A motor-vehicle assessor evaluates the extent of the damage to your car before deciding whether it’s economical to repair or a total loss (i.e. a write-off ). If it’s repairable, they’ll determine the best way to fix the car and how much it will cost."
Who will repair my car?,"After assessing your car's damage and authorising the repairs, we can appoint a repairer. Our network repairers use the latest equipment and methods and are required to carry out each repair to a high and safe standard. Alternatively, you may be able to nominate your preferred repairer if you have the Choice of Repairer optional benefit."
How quickly can I expect my car to be repaired?,"Each repair job is different, so it’s difficult to say for certain how long each job will take. Some can take a few days, others up to two weeks or more, depending on the severity of the damage. The repairer will give you an estimate of how long the job is likely to take and keep you informed of progress."
How do I get my repaired car back?,"Normally, you would collect your fixed car directly from the repairer. If that’s not possible, please contact us to discuss alternative arrangements."
Do you guarantee repairs to my car?,Yes – repairs authorised by us are guaranteed for as long as you own the car.
Can I choose my own repairer?,"You can nominate your preferred repairer as long as your policy includes the ‘choice of repairer’ policy option. If you nominate your preferred repairer, and they are not a repairer from our repair network, we’ll ask you to provide us with the repairer’s quotation for the repairs so we can determine whether: the quotation is competitive, and the proposed repair method is satisfactory. If either of these criteria is not met, we may decide not to authorise the repairs, and instead offer you the option of: having your car repaired by an alternative repairer chosen by us, or paying you the reasonable cost to satisfactorily repair your car. If the car is unsafe to drive, we will pay the cost to tow the car to your preferred repairer up to a maximum of 100 kilometres. Note that, if we authorise your nominated repairer to undertake the repairs, we’ll guarantee the quality of the repairs but not the time it takes to complete them."
Can I arrange for repairs to my car myself?,"Except for essential repairs of up to $500 to make your car driveable following an accident, all repairs must first be authorised by us."
What is a total loss settlement?,"Budget Direct considers a car to be a total loss if it’s: stolen and not recovered damaged to the extent that, having considered all available information and relevant laws, we decide it would be unsafe or uneconomical to repair. If your policy covers theft and/or damage to your car and it becomes a total loss, we’ll usually settle your claim by paying you the amount your car’s insured for. Any applicable excesses will be deducted from the settlement amount. (If you pay your premium in instalments, we’ll also ask you to pay any monies owing for the full period of insurance. Alternatively, we may deduct it from the settlement amount.) If you purchased your comprehensively insured car new or as a demo model and it becomes a total loss within a certain timeframe, we’ll give you a new-car replacement . Your written-off car becomes our property and we keep the proceeds of any salvage sale and we will provide you with the necessary documentation to enable you to apply for a refund of the unused portion of your registration and compulsory third party insurance."
"My car's a total loss, or write-off – what happens now?","If we decide your car is a write-off, we’ll negotiate with you to either: pay you the amount your car is insured for (market or agreed value); or replace your car with a new one of the same make, model and specification if you purchased the car new or as a demo model and it becomes a total loss: Within two years or 40,000km (whichever comes first) of the original registration (Gold Comprehensive Car Insurance) If a new replacement car is not available in Australia, we will pay you the amount you originally paid for the car. If your car is financed, we're obliged to pay the finance company any money you still owe them first. We'll then pay you any residual from the insured amount. We’ll also arrange and pay for your written-off car to be towed away from the repair shop and disposed of."
What is a no-claim discount?,"A no-claim discount (NCD) is a discount on your Comprehensive Car Insurance premium that increases each year you don’t make an at-fault claim . (It’s also known as a no-claim bonus.) The more consecutive years you remain claim-free, the bigger your discount. At Budget Direct, the NCD is capped at 5 years. When you reach this ceiling, we’ll give you a maximum no-claim discount, also known as a Rating 1. (Ratings start at 6 and decrease for every consecutive year you don’t make a claim; the lower your rating, the bigger your discount.)"
How big is my no-claim discount?,"The following table shows the discount you receive on your Budget Direct Comprehensive Car Insurance premium for every year you go without making an at-fault claim . Ratings start at 6 and decrease every consecutive year you don’t make a claim; the lower your rating, the bigger your discount. The table below shows the NCD Rating and the current corresponding discount. Claim-free years NCD rating Discount 5 1 15% 4 2 12% 3 3 9% 2 4 6% 1 5 3% 0 6 (None) 0% Note that minimum premiums may affect the discount you’re entitled to."
What happens to my no claim discount if I make a claim?,"Each time you lodge a claim with Budget Direct, your no claim discount (NCD) is reduced by two levels on renewal of your policy, unless: the accident was not your fault and the at fault party can be identified the damage was caused by severe weather (e.g. hail) your claim is for window glass only you have NCD Protection (subject to conditions). In all other claims scenarios, your NCD would be reduced. For example, if you had a Rating 1 (maximum no-claim discount) and you made one at-fault claim in a given year, your rating would drop to 3."
Can I transfer my no-claim discount to Budget Direct?,"Yes — you can transfer your no-claim discount from your previous insurer to Budget Direct. To do this, you must supply us with proof of your previous discount. For example, you may have a renewal notice from your previous insurer that shows your no-claim discount (or no-claim bonus or driver rating). Alternatively, you can contact the insurer and ask them to send you the notice or other proof, which you can then pass on to us. We’ll factor in the discount when we calculate your premium."
Do you need proof of my no-claim discount from my previous insurer?,"Yes — if you want to transfer your no-claim discount (NCD) from your previous insurer to Budget Direct, you’ll need to provide us with proof of your NCD (or no-claim bonus or driver rating). This proof can be in the form of one of the following: renewal notice or offer from your previous insurer a document showing: you held a 12-month insurance policy at some point within the last 12 months car registration number regular driver or policyholder NCD or driver rating claims (if noted)."
When must I send you proof of my no-claim discount?,You must send us the proof of your no-claim discount (or no-claim bonus or driver rating) within 14 days of the start of your Budget Direct Comprehensive Car Insurance policy.
Where must I send you proof of my no-claim discount?,"First, please check to see if you have received an email or SMS from Budget Direct with a secure link that will allow you to upload your NCD proof - don’t forget to check your junk or spam folder. If you haven’t received either an email or SMS, then please send any renewal offer or letter – with the subject line ‘NCD [ policy number ]’ – to: Email: csd@autogeneral.com.au Fax: 07 3377 8855 Post: Auto & General Services PO Box 342 Toowong QLD 4066"
How can I find out what my no-claim discount or driver rating is?,"If you’re a Budget Direct customer, you can see your no-claim discount (NCD) or driver rating by: logging into your online account referring to your insurance certificate viewing your latest Budget Direct renewal offer contacting us . If you’re not one of our customers, you can find out your NCD by similar means via your current insurer."
Does a no-claim discount guarantee my premium won’t increase?,"No — a no-claim discount (NCD) won’t necessarily stop your Budget Direct Comprehensive Car Insurance premium going up when your policy is renewed. That’s because each year we reassess your risk profile, taking into account not only your discount, but also your claims history, age, how you use the car, and the drivers listed on your policy. This means your premium could be increased before your NCD is applied. So, while your NCD may reduce your new premium, it could still be higher than the previous year. This is the case even if you’ve paid to protect your NCD (remember, you’re paying to protect your discount, not your premium)."
Does windscreen damage affect my no-claim discount?,"No — if you have a Budget Direct Comprehensive Car Insurance policy and you make a claim for window-glass damage only, it will not affect your no-claim discount."
Does theft affect my no-claim discount?,"Yes — if you have a Budget Direct Comprehensive Car Insurance policy and you make a claim for theft, your no-claim discount (NCD) will be reduced by two levels (unless you have NCD Protection ). This is unless the thief is caught and we recover the costs from them, in which case your NCD will not be affected."
Does malicious damage affect my no-claim discount?,"Yes — if you have a Budget Direct Comprehensive Car Insurance policy and you make a claim for malicious damage, your no-claim discount (NCD) will be reduced by two levels (unless you have NCD Protection ). This is unless the vandal is caught and we recover the costs from them, in which case your NCD will not be affected."
Does storm damage affect my no-claim discount?,"No – if you have a Budget Direct Comprehensive Car Insurance policy and you make a claim for storm damage (e.g. hail), it will not affect your no-claim discount."
How many years of claim-free driving can I accumulate?,"At Budget Direct, the no-claim discount is capped at 5 years. After you’ve accrued five or more claim-free years in a row, we’ll give you a maximum no-claim discount, also known as a Rating 1."
Will I lose my no-claim discount if I cancel my car insurance policy?,"If you cancel your Budget Direct Comprehensive Car Insurance policy, you have 12 months to buy another policy in order to keep your no-claim discount (NCD). If you don’t buy a policy (from us or another insurer) within that time, you’ll lose your NCD. If you lose your NCD, you’ll have to start building it up again from scratch (Rating 6). Note that your discount increases each full year you go without making an at-fault claim (up to a maximum of 5 years). If you cancel your policy part-way through a year, that year won’t count towards your NCD. (If you’ve already qualified for the maximum no-claim discount — Rating 1 — cancelling your policy mid-term won’t matter.)"
Does my car have to be continuously insured for me to keep my no-claim discount?,"No – Budget Direct allows you to have a maximum 12-month gap in your cover before you lose your no-claim discount (NCD). If you’re without your own car insurance policy for more than 12 months, you’ll lose your NCD. If you lose your NCD, you’ll have to start building it up again from scratch (Rating 6). This is regardless of whether you were previously insured by us or another provider. If you switch to us from another insurer following a break in your car insurance, we’ll accept NCD proof (e.g. a renewal letter) as long it’s not older than 12 months."
Can I protect my no claim discount?,"If NCD Protection is shown as included on your insurance certificate, your no claim discount (NCD) is protected. Unfortunately, unless NCD Protection was shown as included on your insurance certificate before 28 September 2020 you won’t be able to add it  to your policy."
How does no claim discount protection work?,"If you have Budget Direct’s optional ‘No Claim Discount (NCD) Protection’, you can make a specified number of at fault claims without affecting your NCD. You can make one at fault claim in each 12-month period of insurance up to a maximum of two at  fault claims across three periods (i.e. 36 months) without affecting your NCD. So, even if the accident was your fault or your car was stolen or maliciously damaged and we can’t recover the claim costs, your NCD won’t be reduced. Note that, if you make a claim, at renewal time we’ll reassess your risk profile, regardless of your NCD history. So, while you may not lose your NCD, the discount may apply to an increased premium that reflects your higher risk rating. (If it’s not already shown as included on your insurance certificate, NCD Protection cannot be added to your policy after 28 September 2020. If NCD Protection is shown as included on your insurance certificate, it will continue to form part of your policy until it’s removed.)"
Can I get a rating 1 for life?,"Yes — if ‘Rating 1 for Life’ is shown on your car insurance certificate, you can keep your maximum no claim discount for life — as long as NCD Protection is shown as included on your insurance certificate . (If it’s not already shown as included on your insurance certificate, NCD Protection cannot be added to your policy after 28 September 2020.)"
What happens if I don’t have no claim discount protection?,"If NCD Protection is not shown as included on your insurance certificate, each time you lodge an at fault claim with Budget Direct your NCD will be reduced by two levels on renewal of your policy. For example, if you had a Rating 1 (maximum no claim discount) and you made one at fault claim in a given year, your rating would drop to 3. This means the current discount on your Budget Direct Comprehensive Car Insurance premium would fall from 15% (Rating 1) to 9% (Rating 3). (If it’s not already shown as included on your insurance certificate, NCD Protection cannot be added to your policy after 28 September 2020.)"
Can any driver listed on a policy build up a no-claim discount?,"No – only the person listed as the regular driver on a Budget Direct Comprehensive Car Insurance policy can build up a no-claim discount (NCD). This prevents household members and other drivers listed on the policy from potentially accruing years of claim-free driving without actually driving the car. If, however, one of the other drivers has an at-fault accident that leads to a claim, the regular driver’s NCD will be reduced by two levels (unless they have NCD Protection ). For example, if you’re the regular driver and you add your learner-driver child to your policy and they cause an accident, your NCD will be reduced."
Does the no-claim discount apply to work vehicles?,"Yes — Budget Direct’s no-claim discount (NCD) applies not only to cars used privately, but also cars used by the regular driver for their own business. We’ll also recognise any NCD or driver rating you earned while you had exclusive use of a company car, before you gave it up. For example, if you leave the company and have to buy a new family car, we’ll give you a rating based on the number of consecutive claim-free years you drove the company car. As proof of your NCD, we’ll need you to give us a letter from either: an authorised person on company letterhead your former employer’s insurance company. The letter must confirm: the regular driver (i.e. you) is no longer insured the number of years you drove without any claims."
I’m taking out insurance in my name for the first time — can I be given my spouse or partner’s driver rating?,"Yes — if you’re new to insurance, Budget Direct can give you your spouse or partner’s no-claim discount (NCD) or driver rating. (This is assuming they have not only recently attained their learners or provisional licence, in which case you would not be entitled to their NCD rating.) Your spouse or partner’s car insurance policy must show them as the policyholder or regular driver."
Can I transfer a no-claim discount from overseas?,"Depending on which foreign country you’ve been living in, you may be able transfer the no-claim discount (NCD) you built up overseas to your Budget Direct Comprehensive Car Insurance policy. We recognise discounts earned in about two dozen countries outside Australia. To find out which ones they are, please contact us . You’ll need to give us proof of the NCD you earned abroad. This proof must be written in English."
What’s the difference between a no-claim discount and a loyalty discount?,"A no-claim discount (NCD) is a discount on your comprehensive car insurance premium that increases each year you don’t make an at-fault claim . The more consecutive years you remain claim-free, the bigger your NCD, up to a certain limit. As its name suggests, a loyalty discount is a discount insurance policyholders earn by faithfully sticking with the same insurer. The more policies you have with the insurer and the longer you stay with them, the bigger your discount, up to a certain limit. Even with your NCD and loyalty discounts, however, you could be paying hundreds of dollars more than you would if you switched insurers."
What is an at fault car insurance claim?,"Budget Direct defines an ‘at fault claim’ as any claim that cannot be recovered from another party, either in part or in full, such as: an accident where, given all available evidence, it is reasonable for us to decide the driver of the Budget Direct-insured car is partially or entirely at fault an accident where, given all available evidence, it is reasonable for us to decide the driver of the other vehicle or another person is entirely at fault but you cannot tell us, or we cannot obtain, their full name, residential address and vehicle registration number theft, attempted, theft or a malicious act storm, wind or hail fire an accident involving an animal. If you make an at fault claim, you’ll need to pay the applicable excess/es; and your no claim discount (NCD) will be reduced by two levels (unless you have NCD Protection ). Note that your discount is not affected by claims arising from storm, wind or hail damage (even if you don’t have NCD Protection)."
How can I see and change my car insurance policy details?,"You can view and manage many of your Budget Direct car insurance policy details – including your contact details, payment preferences, drivers, excesses and optional benefits – through your online account . You can access your account at your convenience, on any device, 24/7. (You can also see some of your policy details on your certificate of insurance.)"
